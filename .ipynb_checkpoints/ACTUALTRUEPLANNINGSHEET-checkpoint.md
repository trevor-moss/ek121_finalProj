**Labor hours**

BIG CHANGE!! Post WWII: 96hr/ww --> 40hr/ww (in USA, and others)
How did this impact labor, work culture

**Hypotheses**
1. Major world events (WWII) had a global impact in shifting work hours
    * Overlay billion countries time series work week
    <p> <br> </p>
2. Though similar trend down in standard hours, work cultures differ (as observed through overtime hours)
    * Plot max overtime hours, cluster
    * Scatter Plot: x-axis: time(years), y-axis: max overtime hours
    * Look at trend then compare to work culture 
    <p> <br> </p>
3. Compare working hours btw the Axis and Allies (before and after)
