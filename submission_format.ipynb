    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Political Scientist Magnus Bergli Rasmussen published a dataset on government advised working hours, covering 203 unique countries and territories from 1789 to 2020. For each year and country/governing body, Rasmussen provides:\n",
    "* Existence of work laws\n",
    "* Advised # of normal working hours in a week\n",
    "* Maximum hours allowed\n",
    "* Percentage increase in pay for overtime work\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing this dataset, we can observe the expectations of working hours, and therefore get a general idea of work culture throughout time and within various countries. Furthermore, we can observe shifts in this culture, as well as changes in leisure time and living standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hypotheses\n",
    "1. We hypothesized that globally, normal working hours have decreased over time. \n",
    "2. We believe that max regulated overtime hours globally would have also decreased as time went on, and that there is a link between overtime compensation and maximum overtime hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "1. We were correct, but only to a degree. Despite the normal working hours decreasing over time, there is not a clear shift during a certain time period. Especially for the United Kingdom, their switch from 96 hours to 40 hours did not occur until 1999, which is much later than most other countries. In the modern day, most—if not all—countries have lowered their normal working hours to around 40 hours.\n",
    "2. We were incorrect. For most countries, the maximum overtime hours along with the overtime compensation was set once and still stands today, despite the changes that have happened."

    "As reflected in the plot, we can see that normal working hours in the United States changed drastically around the late 30s and early to mid 40s. There is only one major shift here, rather than a gradual trend downwards. Looking at this data, we initially thought this shift might have been caused by World War II. However, the shift in working hours occurs in 1938, which can be seen if the graph is examined closely. This is a year before the war started, so there is likely little to no connection here. More likely, this new labor law was introduced (Reference 4) as a response to the great depression. While this trend matches our hypothesis, examining a single country, subject to factors the rest of the world might not be, would be irresponsible. So, we should examine all the countries in this dataset together."

    "Here, we clearly see the trend in each country to lowering labor hours to the modern day. The shifts seen here are not simultaneous, perhaps indicating that countries experienced similar pressures but at different moments in history. These shifts are more localized than we initially thought, with a country like the United Kingdom setting its lower Normal Working Hours much later than others. Of these countries, most experienced shifts much earlier than this, but not all clustered around the 1940s, which is when the United States felt a similar shift. However, all these countries did indeed shift in a similar way, with each greatly reducing expected labor hours. Therefore, our hypothesis holds up for these countries, and for the wider world, given what we can observe from Figure 1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these comparisons, we can see that working hours have generally decreased over time. This trend can be explained through a multitude of factors, not just one event. However, the lower normal work hours suggests that society has become more productive in the modern day. By looking at more specific countries, and using the expected working hours, we can identify trends from the past to predict future changes in work hours. Also, we can see how the standard of living and work culture have changed throughout time. As work hours decrease, people have experienced an increase in more time for leisure activities. Further, we can compare the work culture between different countries. For example, a country with higher normal working hours, would have higher expectations for individual workers. This could also be reflected by overtime hours, where the expectation of working overtime would increase. "

    "In fact, the overtime compensation workers recieve today is likely to be the same overtime compensation workers recieved a century ago. This warrents further exploration into the number of hours worked overtime per capita, and if our old overtime system is compensating workers fairly in the modern day. Furthermore, this dataset only captures legal limits of overtime. While it's unlikely for employers to exceed overtime hours, there may be after-hours work that is not compensated and/or recorded. Such work is a reflection of cultural expectations, and would be important to investigate for deeper discussion on this topic."
